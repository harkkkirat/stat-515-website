### Research Question 1

#### Overview

**Research Question 1:** How do liver enzyme levels (ALP, ALT, AST) change with age in people with hepatitis C compared to healthy individuals?

This research investigates how liver enzymes, which are important for diagnosing liver issues, vary as people get older, especially comparing those with hepatitis C to healthy people.

#### Data Preparation and Analysis

**Data Preparation:** - We used data from the `hcvdat.csv` dataset focusing on age and liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, AST). - We removed missing values and grouped data into age categories ('Young', 'Middle-aged', 'Senior') to analyze trends based on age.

**Model Training and Validation:** 
- A **Random Forest model** was chosen for its robustness in handling datasets with multiple predictors. It was trained to predict log-transformed Albumin levels. 
- **10-fold cross-validation** was used to validate the model, ensuring it performs well across different data subsets.

**Model Evaluation:** - The model's accuracy was assessed with **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** and **R-squared** values, where it scored an R-squared of **0.937**. This means about 93.7% of the variability in Albumin levels was explained by the model. - The RMSE was **0.035**, showing the model's precision in predictions.

#### Visualizations and Insights

**Enzyme Level Analysis by Age Group:** - We made a bar plot to show average liver enzyme levels by age group, which helps us see changes in enzyme levels across ages, especially noting increases in older groups.

**Model Fit Visualization:** - **Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot:** Checked to ensure our model fits well. The plot showed residuals spread randomly, suggesting the model was appropriate without any clear misfit patterns.

#### Approaches Considered and Rejected

We initially considered several methods: 
- **Non-linear Models:** These were tested for capturing complex relationships but not used due to the risk of making the model too complex. 
- **Polynomial Regression:** Was also considered to deal with curves in the data but was not used to keep the model simple and easy to interpret.

#### Real-World Application

The findings are useful for: 
- **Early Diagnosis:** Better understanding of how liver enzymes change with age helps in spotting liver issues early. 
- **Personalizing Treatment:** Insights from the data can guide tailored treatments based on how enzyme levels change with age.

#### Conclusion

This study effectively used a Random Forest model to clarify how age impacts liver enzyme levels in hepatitis C patients compared to healthy individuals. It provided useful insights that could improve how liver conditions are managed.

#### Future Directions

Further research could improve these findings by: 
- **Including more factors** like broader demographic details and other health indicators to enhance predictions. 
- **Conducting longitudinal studies** to observe changes in enzyme levels over time, giving more insight into how liver diseases progress.
