From a young age, roller hockey became a passion, leading me to compete and win medals at district, state, and national levels for over 15 years. My dedication to the sport taught me discipline, perseverance, and the importance of teamwork, as I balanced rigorous training sessions with my studies. Additionally, I’ve volunteered in various capacities and contributed to the managing committee of techno-cultural festivals, enhancing my organizational and management skills. These experiences have not only enriched my personal growth but also prepared me for collaborative and leadership roles in my professional journey."

    "text": "Global Automation:\nThis project exemplifies my venture into smart automation, capable of enhancing convenience in homes and offices by controlling AC/heaters remotely, and even operating devices in hazardous areas where human intervention is risky. Developed using C language, it leverages the DTMF IC technology to interpret signals from mobile phone buttons, showcasing my ability to integrate simple technologies for complex solutions.\n\n\nExpense Manager Application:\nIn the pursuit of creating practical tools for everyday use, I developed an Android-based mobile application aimed at managing group expenses. Utilizing Kotlin and XML, this application serves as a dynamic tool to track and analyze budgets, encouraging efficient financial management. This project reflects my knack for developing user-friendly digital solutions that cater to the needs of managing personal finances.\n\n\nSmart Plant Monitoring System:\nMerging my interests in sustainability and technology, I designed a system that uses IoT to monitor plant health. By incorporating sensors and the Blynk IoT platform, along with C language, the system tracks humidity, temperature, and soil moisture, automating irrigation processes. This project is a testament to my commitment to environmental conservation through the innovative use of technology."
