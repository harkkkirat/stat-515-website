Beyond my academic pursuits, I've been actively engaged in extracurricular activities that have significantly shaped my teamwork and leadership skills. From a young age, roller hockey became a passion, leading me to compete and win medals at district, state, and national levels for over 15 years. My dedication to the sport taught me discipline, perseverance, and the importance of teamwork, as I balanced rigorous training sessions with my studies. Additionally, I've volunteered in various capacities and contributed to the managing committee of techno-cultural festivals, enhancing my organizational and management skills. These experiences have not only enriched my personal growth but also prepared me for collaborative and leadership roles in my professional journey.
