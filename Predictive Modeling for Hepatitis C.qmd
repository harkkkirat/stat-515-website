# Hepatitis C Data Analysis

This webpage consolidates the detailed research conducted for three distinct research questions based on the Hepatitis C dataset. Each section retains the original formatting and content from the individual webpages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Question 1: Age and Liver Enzymes

### 0.1 Overview

**Research Question 1:** How do liver enzyme levels (ALP, ALT, AST) change with age in people with hepatitis C compared to healthy individuals?

This research investigates how liver enzymes, which are important for diagnosing liver issues, vary as people get older, especially comparing those with hepatitis C to healthy people.

### 0.2 Data Preparation and Analysis

**Data Preparation**\
- Focused on age and liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, AST) by removing missing values and grouping data into age categories ('Young', 'Middle-aged', 'Senior').

**Model Training and Validation**\
- A **Random Forest model** with 10-fold cross-validation achieved: - **R-squared:** 0.937 (explaining 93.7% of variability in Albumin levels). - **RMSE:** 0.035 (high precision in predictions).

### 0.3 Visualizations

2.  **Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot**\

### 0.4 Approaches Considered and Rejected

-   **Non-linear Models:** Rejected due to the risk of overcomplication.
-   **Polynomial Regression:** Avoided for simplicity and interpretability.

### 0.5 Real-World Application

-   **Early Diagnosis:** Understanding enzyme changes aids in spotting liver issues early.
-   **Personalized Treatment:** Tailored treatments based on enzyme changes with age.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Question 2: Gender Influence on Biochemical Responses

### 0.1 Overview

**Research Question 2:** Does gender influence biochemical responses in hepatitis C patients?

This question explores how Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), an enzyme crucial for assessing liver health, varies between male and female hepatitis C patients.

### 0.2 Data Preparation and Analysis

**Data Preparation**\
- Focused on variables like gender, GGT levels, age, and hepatitis C status. - Removed missing values for accuracy.

**Statistical Analysis**\
- **ANOVA and Multiple Regression Models**: Quantified gender differences and interactions with age. - **Interaction Effects**: Explored age and gender interaction on GGT levels.

### 0.3 Visualizations

1.  **Interaction of Category, Sex, and Age on log(GGT) Levels**\

### 0.4 Real-World Application

-   **Tailored Treatment Strategies:** Insights enable personalized treatments for males and females.
-   **Enhanced Disease Understanding:** Improves understanding of gender-biased biochemical responses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Question 3: Predicting Severity of Liver Disease

### 0.1 Overview

**Research Question 3:** How can we predict the severity of liver disease in patients?

The goal was to classify disease stages using biochemical markers and demographic data, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

### 0.2 Methodology

**Predictive Modeling**\
- Models: Random Forest and Multinomial Logistic Regression. - Validation: Cross-validation to prevent overfitting.

**Evaluation**\
- **AUC Scores:** - Blood Donor: 0.99 - Hepatitis: 0.99 - Fibrosis: 0.99 - Cirrhosis: 0.82

### 0.3 Visualizations

1.  **Confusion Matrix Heatmap**\

3.  **Variable Importance Plot**\

### 0.4 Real-World Application

-   **Support for Clinical Decisions:** Enhances diagnostic accuracy.
-   **Managing Healthcare Resources:** Prioritizes care for severe cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

The consolidated analysis across these research questions provides a comprehensive understanding of liver disease dynamics, enabling improved diagnostic and treatment methods.
